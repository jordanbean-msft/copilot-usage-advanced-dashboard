# Introduction

[Copilot Usage Advanced Dashboard](https://github.com/satomic/copilot-usage-advanced-dashboard) is a single data panel display that almost fully utilizes data from Copilot APIs, The APIs used are:

- [List teams of an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/teams/teams?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-teams)
- [Get a summary of Copilot metrics for a team](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-metrics?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-copilot-metrics-for-a-team)
- [Get Copilot seat information and settings for an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-user-management?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-copilot-seat-information-and-settings-for-an-organization)
- [List all Copilot seat assignments for an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-user-management?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-all-copilot-seat-assignments-for-an-organization)

representing Copilot usage in multi organizations & teams from different dimensions. The features are summarized as follows:
- Data is persisted in Elasticsearch and visualized in Grafana, **not just the past 28 days**. So you can freely choose the time period you want to visualize, such as the past year or a specific month.
- You can freely adjust the style and theme of the chart, everything is a mature feature of Grafana.
- All stored data includes Organization and Team fields, which is convenient for data filtering through variable filters.
- Generate a unique hash key for each piece of data, and update the stored data every time the latest data is obtained.
- Visualizations in Grafana dashboards can be adjusted or deleted according to actual needs.
- Based on Grafana's built-in alerting function, you can set alert rules for some inappropriate usage behaviors, such as sending alerts to users who have been inactive for a long time.
- It can be easily integrated with third-party systems, whether it is extracting data from Elasticsearch to other data visualization platforms for data visualization, or adding other data sources in the Copilot Usage Advanced Dashboard for joint data visualization.

## Online Demo Environment

> Designed 2 dashboards, both can exist at the same time in Grafana.

# Features

## Copilot Usage Advanced Dashboard

### 1. Organization
> First, based on [List teams of an onganization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/teams/teams?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-teams), get all the teams under the Organization, and then based on [Get a summary of Copilot usage for a team](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-summary-of-copilot-usage-for-a-team), sum and calculate the data of all teams under the Organization to get complete Organization-level data.

- Acceptance Rate Average = `sum(total_acceptances_count) / sum(total_suggestions_count)`
- Cumulative Number of Acceptence (Count) = `sum(total_acceptances_count)`
- Cumulative Number of Suggestions (Count) = `sum(total_suggestions_count)`
- Cumulative Number of Lines of Code Accepted = `sum(total_lines_accepted)`
- Acceptance Rate (%) = `total_acceptances_count / total_suggestions_count`
- Total Active Users = `total_active_users`
- Total Suggestions & Acceptances Count = `total_suggestions_count` & `total_acceptances_count`
- Total Lines Suggested & Accepted = `total_lines_suggested `& `total_lines_accepted`

![](image/image_WVNHVnb2OZ.png)

### 2. Teams
> Based on the breakdown data in [Get a summary of Copilot usage for a team](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-summary-of-copilot-usage-for-a-team), the data is aggregated by Teams to obtain data comparisons of different Teams.

- Number of Teams = `unique_count(team_slug)`
- Top Teams by Accepted Prompts = `sum(acceptances_count).groupby(team_slug)`
- Top Teams by Acceptance Rate = `sum(acceptances_count).groupby(team_slug) / sum(suggestions_count).groupby(team_slug)`
- Team Breakdown = `sum(*).groupby(team_slug)`

![](image/image_TGcs3tD7Cs.png)

### 3. Languages

> Based on the breakdown data in [Get a summary of Copilot usage for a team](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-summary-of-copilot-usage-for-a-team), the data is aggregated according to Languages ​​to obtain data comparisons for different Languages.

- Number of Languages= `unique_count(language)`
- Top Languages by Accepted Prompts = `sum(acceptances_count).groupby(language)`
- Top Languages by Acceptance Rate = `sum(acceptances_count).groupby(language) / sum(suggestions_count).groupby(language)`
- Languages Breakdown = `sum(*).groupby(language)`

![](image/image_YHXpu1wRf2.png)

### 4. Editors

> Based on the breakdown data in [Get a summary of Copilot usage for a team](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-summary-of-copilot-usage-for-a-team), the data is aggregated by Editors to obtain data comparisons for different Editors.

- Number of Editors = `unique_count(editor)`
- Top Editors by Accepted Prompts = `sum(acceptances_count).groupby(editor)`
- Top Editors by Acceptance Rate = `sum(acceptances_count).groupby(editor) / sum(suggestions_count).groupby(editor)`
- Editors Breakdown = `sum(*).groupby(editor)`

![](image/image_9P1zJxBMaO.png)

### 5. Copilot Chat

> Based on the data from [Get a summary of Copilot usage for a team](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-summary-of-copilot-usage-for-a-team), we can get the usage of Copilot Chat.

- Acceptance Rate Average = `sum(total_chat_acceptances) / sum(total_chat_turns)`
- Cumulative Number of Acceptances = `sum(total_chat_acceptances)`
- Cumulative Number of Turns = `sum(total_chat_turns)`
- Total Acceptances | Total Turns Count = `total_chat_acceptances` | `total_chat_turns`
- Total Active Copilot Chat Users = `total_active_chat_users`

![](image/image_chat.png)

### 6. Seat Analysis

> Based on the data analysis of [Get Copilot seat information and settings for an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-user-management?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-copilot-seat-information-and-settings-for-an-organization) and [List all Copilot seat assignments for an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-user-management?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-all-copilot-seat-assignments-for-an-organization), the seat allocation and usage are presented in a unified manner.

- Copilot Plan Type = `count(seats).groupby(plan_type)`
- Total = `seat_breakdown.total`
- Active in this Cycle = `seat_breakdown.active_this_cycle`
- Assigned But Never Used = `last_activity_at.isnan()`
- Inactive in this Cycle = `seat_breakdown.inactive_this_cycle`
- Ranking of Inactive Users ( ≥ 2 days ) =  `today - last_activity_at`
- All assigned seats = `*`

![](image/image_vNpkYpc-xW.png)

### 7. Breakdown Heatmap

> Based on the breakdown data in [Get a summary of Copilot usage for a team](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-summary-of-copilot-usage-for-a-team), we analyze the data from two dimensions: Languages ​​and Editors. We can clearly see what combination of Languages ​​and Editors can achieve the best Copilot usage effect.

- Active Users Count (Group by Language) = `active_users.groupby(language)`
- Accept Rate by Count (%) = `sum(acceptances_count).groupby(language) / sum(suggestions_count).groupby(language)`
- Accept Rate by Lines (%) = `sum(lines_accepted).groupby(language) / sum(lines_suggested).groupby(language)`
- Active Users Count (Group by Editor) = `active_users.groupby(editor)`
- Accept Rate by Count (%) = `sum(acceptances_count).groupby(editor) / sum(suggestions_count).groupby(editor)`
- Accept Rate by Lines (%) = `sum(lines_accepted).groupby(editor) / sum(lines_suggested).groupby(editor)`

# Deployment

When setting up a deployment you will need to set the following variables for your pipeline manually:

|**Variable**|**Description**|
|-|-|
|AZURE_ENV_NAME|The name of the Azure environment you want to deploy to, such as dev, test, prod, etc.|
|AZURE_LOCATION|The Azure location you want to deploy to, such as eastus, westus, etc.|
|AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP|The name of the resource group you want to deploy to.|
|AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID|The GUID for the subscription you want to deploy to.|
|GH_ORGANIZATION_SLUGS|This is your GitHub Organization name.|
|GH_PAT|This is your GitHub Personal Access Token.  Mark this variable as secret in your pipeline.|

## Azure DevOps
If you are using Azure DevOps, make sure you change the name of the service connection to the name of your service connection.  You will need to change line 
30 and 45 of the azure-dev.yml file.

To create a service connection you can use the azd pipeline config --provider azdo command from the terminal.  You can read more here:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/pipeline-azure-pipelines.

You will need to install the "Install azd" extension from the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.azd) in your Azure DevOps organization if you haven't already done so.

You will need to manually create the DevOps variables yourself in the Azure DevOps GUI.  

## GitHub Actions
You will create a pipeline using the azure-dev.yml file located in the .github\workflows folder. You will need to manually create the GitHub variables yourself in the Azure DevOps GUI. 

## 1. Azure Container Apps
if you are using Azure Container Apps, please refer to the [Azure Container Apps deployment document](deploy/azure-container-apps.md).

![](image/architecture.drawio.png)

### Deploying as `Contributor`

Deployment adds required role assignments, which require `User Access Administrator` RBAC role (more permissions than `Contributor`) or `Owner` RBAC role.

To deploy as `Contributor` RBAC role, pass `doRoleAssignments` parameter set to `false` or set `AZURE_ROLE_ASSIGNMENTS` environment variable when deploying with `azd`.

Required role assignments:

- **Key Vault Secrets Officer** on the KeyVault assigned to User Assigned Identity
- **AcrPull** on the Azure Container Registry assigned to User Assigned Identity
- **Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor** on the Storage Account assigned to User Assigned Identity

## 2. Linux with Docker
If you are not using Azure, you can use Linux with Docker, please refer to the [Linux with Docker deployment document](deploy/linux-with-docker.md).
