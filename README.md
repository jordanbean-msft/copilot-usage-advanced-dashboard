# Introduction

[Copilot Usage Advanced Dashboard](https://github.com/satomic/copilot-usage-advanced-dashboard) is a single data panel display that almost fully utilizes data from Copilot APIs, The APIs used are:

- [List teams of an onganization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/teams/teams?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-teams)
- [Get a summary of Copilot metrics for a team](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-metrics?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-copilot-metrics-for-a-team)
- [Get Copilot seat information and settings for an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-user-management?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-copilot-seat-information-and-settings-for-an-organization)
- [List all Copilot seat assignments for an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-user-management?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-all-copilot-seat-assignments-for-an-organization)

representing Copilot usage in multi organizations & teams from different dimensions. The features are summarized as follows:
- Data is persisted in Elasticsearch and visualized in Grafana, **not just the past 28 days**. So you can freely choose the time period you want to visualize, such as the past year or a specific month.
- You can freely adjust the style and theme of the chart, everything is a mature feature of Grafana.
- All stored data includes Organization and Team fields, which is convenient for data filtering through variable filters.
- Generate a unique hash key for each piece of data, and update the stored data every time the latest data is obtained.
- Visualizations in Grafana dashboards can be adjusted or deleted according to actual needs.
- Based on Grafana's built-in alerting function, you can set alert rules for some inappropriate usage behaviors, such as sending alerts to users who have been inactive for a long time.
- It can be easily integrated with third-party systems, whether it is extracting data from Elasticsearch to other data visualization platforms for data visualization, or adding other data sources in the Copilot Usage Advanced Dashboard for joint data visualization.

## Online Demo Environment

> Designed 2 dashboards, both can exist at the same time in Grafana.

# Features

## Copilot Usage Advanced Dashboard

### 1. Organization
> First, based on [List teams of an onganization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/teams/teams?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-teams), get all the teams under the Organization, and then based on [Get a summary of Copilot usage for a team](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-summary-of-copilot-usage-for-a-team), sum and calculate the data of all teams under the Organization to get complete Organization-level data.

- Acceptance Rate Average = `sum(total_acceptances_count) / sum(total_suggestions_count)`
- Cumulative Number of Acceptence (Count) = `sum(total_acceptances_count)`
- Cumulative Number of Suggestions (Count) = `sum(total_suggestions_count)`
- Cumulative Number of Lines of Code Accepted = `sum(total_lines_accepted)`
- Acceptance Rate (%) = `total_acceptances_count / total_suggestions_count`
- Total Active Users = `total_active_users`
- Total Suggestions & Acceptances Count = `total_suggestions_count` & `total_acceptances_count`
- Total Lines Suggested & Accepted = `total_lines_suggested `& `total_lines_accepted`

![](image/image_WVNHVnb2OZ.png)

### 2. Teams
> Based on the breakdown data in [Get a summary of Copilot usage for a team](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-summary-of-copilot-usage-for-a-team), the data is aggregated by Teams to obtain data comparisons of different Teams.

- Number of Teams = `unique_count(team_slug)`
- Top Teams by Accepted Prompts = `sum(acceptances_count).groupby(team_slug)`
- Top Teams by Acceptance Rate = `sum(acceptances_count).groupby(team_slug) / sum(suggestions_count).groupby(team_slug)`
- Team Breakdown = `sum(*).groupby(team_slug)`

![](image/image_TGcs3tD7Cs.png)

### 3. Languages

> Based on the breakdown data in [Get a summary of Copilot usage for a team](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-summary-of-copilot-usage-for-a-team), the data is aggregated according to Languages ​​to obtain data comparisons for different Languages.

- Number of Languages= `unique_count(language)`
- Top Languages by Accepted Prompts = `sum(acceptances_count).groupby(language)`
- Top Languages by Acceptance Rate = `sum(acceptances_count).groupby(language) / sum(suggestions_count).groupby(language)`
- Languages Breakdown = `sum(*).groupby(language)`

![](image/image_YHXpu1wRf2.png)

### 4. Editors

> Based on the breakdown data in [Get a summary of Copilot usage for a team](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-summary-of-copilot-usage-for-a-team), the data is aggregated by Editors to obtain data comparisons for different Editors.

- Number of Editors = `unique_count(editor)`
- Top Editors by Accepted Prompts = `sum(acceptances_count).groupby(editor)`
- Top Editors by Acceptance Rate = `sum(acceptances_count).groupby(editor) / sum(suggestions_count).groupby(editor)`
- Editors Breakdown = `sum(*).groupby(editor)`

![](image/image_9P1zJxBMaO.png)

### 5. Copilot Chat

> Based on the data from [Get a summary of Copilot usage for a team](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-summary-of-copilot-usage-for-a-team), we can get the usage of Copilot Chat.

- Acceptance Rate Average = `sum(total_chat_acceptances) / sum(total_chat_turns)`
- Cumulative Number of Acceptances = `sum(total_chat_acceptances)`
- Cumulative Number of Turns = `sum(total_chat_turns)`
- Total Acceptances | Total Turns Count = `total_chat_acceptances` | `total_chat_turns`
- Total Active Copilot Chat Users = `total_active_chat_users`

![](image/image_chat.png)

### 6. Seat Analysis

> Based on the data analysis of [Get Copilot seat information and settings for an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-user-management?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-copilot-seat-information-and-settings-for-an-organization) and [List all Copilot seat assignments for an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-user-management?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-all-copilot-seat-assignments-for-an-organization), the seat allocation and usage are presented in a unified manner.

- Copilot Plan Type = `count(seats).groupby(plan_type)`
- Total = `seat_breakdown.total`
- Active in this Cycle = `seat_breakdown.active_this_cycle`
- Assigned But Never Used = `last_activity_at.isnan()`
- Inactive in this Cycle = `seat_breakdown.inactive_this_cycle`
- Ranking of Inactive Users ( ≥ 2 days ) =  `today - last_activity_at`
- All assigned seats = `*`

![](image/image_vNpkYpc-xW.png)

### 7. Breakdown Heatmap

> Based on the breakdown data in [Get a summary of Copilot usage for a team](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-summary-of-copilot-usage-for-a-team), we analyze the data from two dimensions: Languages ​​and Editors. We can clearly see what combination of Languages ​​and Editors can achieve the best Copilot usage effect.

- Active Users Count (Group by Language) = `active_users.groupby(language)`
- Accept Rate by Count (%) = `sum(acceptances_count).groupby(language) / sum(suggestions_count).groupby(language)`
- Accept Rate by Lines (%) = `sum(lines_accepted).groupby(language) / sum(lines_suggested).groupby(language)`
- Active Users Count (Group by Editor) = `active_users.groupby(editor)`
- Accept Rate by Count (%) = `sum(acceptances_count).groupby(editor) / sum(suggestions_count).groupby(editor)`
- Accept Rate by Lines (%) = `sum(lines_accepted).groupby(editor) / sum(lines_suggested).groupby(editor)`

![](image/image_i7-wXGj-UA.png)

## Copilot Usage Advanced Dashboard Original

### 1. Copilot Seat Info & Top Languages

# Special Notes

Everything described in this article is based on the all-in-one architecture. In a production environment, it can be split into a distributed architecture based on actual needs.

## Architecture diagram

![](image/image_oZJ-KGOxa5.png)

## Technology stack

Dependent technology stack:

- VM
- docker
- Elasticsearch&#x20;
- Grafana
- Python3

***

# Deployment

> All operations are performed in the VM

## Prerequisites

> everything is on-premises and free (except VM)

The only thing you need is:

- a VM
  - Memory: 16G is recommended
  - Operating system: Ubuntu 22.04 (recommended, other operating systems have no difference except Docker installation)
  - Port: `3000` port needs to be released for Grafana to use, and `22` port can be determined by yourself.

Everything else is based on existing stuff, or based on open source software, no extra cost, for example:

- GitHub Organzations with Copilot enabled (I believe, you already have it)
- Docker (Community Version is enough)
- Elasticsearch (Community Version is enough)
- Grafana (Community Version is enough, do not need Grafana Cloud Account)
- CPUAD-Updater build from this project (MIT license)

## Docker

For installation instructions, refer to [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). For Ubuntu 22.04, you can use the following command

## Elasticsearch

### Installation

> If you already have ES, you can skip this step and go directly to the next step.

> ES will not be exposed to the outside of the VM, so there is no need to enable `xpack.security.enabled`

1. Create a data persistence directory and a configuration file directory for Elasticsearch:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /srv/elasticsearch/data /srv/elasticsearch/config
   ```
2. Grant read and write permissions.
   ```bash
   chmod -R a+rw /srv/elasticsearch/
   ```
3. Create the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file in the `/srv/elasticsearch/config/`directory:
   ```bash
   cat >> /srv/elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml << EOF
   network.host: 0.0.0.0
   node.name: single-node
   cluster.name: es-docker-cluster
   path.data: /usr/share/elasticsearch/data
   path.logs: /usr/share/elasticsearch/logs
   discovery.type: single-node
   bootstrap.memory_lock: true
   EOF
   ```
4. Use the following command to start Elasticsearch and bind the data directory and configuration file:
   ```bash

4. Congratulations, you now have a complete dashboard, but there should be no data yet. Next, run the core program.

## cpuad-updater

> is the abbreviation of the first characters of **Copilot Usage Advanced Dashboard Updater**

### Option 1. Run in docker mode (recommended)

Parameter description

- `GITHUB_PAT`: 
  - Your GitHub account needs to have Owner permissions for Organizations. 
  - [Create a personal access token (classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) of your account with the `manage_billing:copilot`, `read:enterprise`, `read:org` scope. Then please replace `<YOUR_GITHUB_PAT>` with the actual PAT.
  - If you encounter PAT permission error, please **Allow access via fine-grained personal access tokens** in Organization's **Settings** - **Personal access tokens**.
- `ORGANIZATION_SLUGS`: The Slugs of all Organizations that you want to monitor, which can be one or multiple separated by `,` (English symbol). **If you are using Copilot Standalone, use your Standalone Slug here, prefixed with `standalone:`, for example `standalone:YOUR_STANDALONE_SLUG`**. Please replace `<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_SLUGS>` with the actual value. For example, the following types of values are supported:
  - `myOrg1`
  - `myOrg1,myOrg2`
  - `standalone:myStandaloneSlug`
  - `myOrg1,standalone:myStandaloneSlug`
- `LOG_PATH`: Log storage location, not recommended to modify. If modified, you need to modify the `-v` data volume mapping simultaneously.
- `EXECUTION_INTERVAL`: Update interval, the default is to update the program every `1` hours.

```bash
docker run -itd \
--net=host \
--restart=always \
--name cpuad \
-e GITHUB_PAT="<YOUR_GITHUB_PAT>" \
-e ORGANIZATION_SLUGS="<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_SLUGS>" \
-e LOG_PATH="logs" \
-e EXECUTION_INTERVAL=1 \
-e ELASTICSEARCH_URL="http://localhost:9200" \
-v /srv/cpuad-updater-logs:/app/logs \
satomic/cpuad-updater
```

### Option 2. Run in source code mode

1. Confirm that you are in the correct path
   ```bash
   cd /srv/copilot-usage-advanced-dashboard
   ```
2. Install Dependencies
   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Setting Environment Variables. **If you are using Copilot Standalone, use your Standalone Slug here, prefixed with `standalone:`, for example `standalone:YOUR_STANDALONE_SLUG`**.
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_PAT="<YOUR_GITHUB_PAT>"
   export ORGANIZATION_SLUGS="<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_SLUGS>"

   ```
4. run
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```
5. output logs
   ```text
